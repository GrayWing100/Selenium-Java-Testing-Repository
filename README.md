# Selenium-Java-Testing-Repository

## Project Description
This repository includes a number of Java-based automated tests created with Selenium WebDriver. It highlights excellent practices for user interface testing in web applications, such as cart features, login processes, and other crucial user interactions. With setup and teardown procedures to maximize test independence and dependability, each test is structured to guarantee modular, manageable, and reusable code.This repository includes a number of Java-based automated tests created with Selenium WebDriver.
